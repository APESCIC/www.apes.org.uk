<span class="pill pill-version">Version v2.6.0</span>
<span class="pill pill-status">Stable</span>
<span class="pill pill-type">Changed</span>

<span class="pill pill-compliance">Compliance</span>

### Summary

Added a shared APES image system across key public routes, bringing supportive photography and illustration into the homepage, route-finder, fundraising, bookings, educational and relocation journeys while keeping release, footer and Newsroom rules aligned.

### Detailed changes

- Added six deployable APES image assets plus WebP variants inside the public asset tree and wired them through shared PHP rendering with explicit dimensions, responsive picture markup and lazy loading for non-hero placements.
- Extended the shared renderer and stylesheet so homepage hero media, route-finder illustrations and reusable feature-media sections can be enabled per page without changing public routes, footer links or form behaviour.
- Placed the new visuals on the homepage, Services hub, Bookings, Educational visits, About APES, Fundraising priorities and Help Us Move routes using conservative descriptive copy that supports the public journeys without implying named animals or live case evidence.
- Preserved APES Newsroom routing, the APES column-card footer, required donation, Privacy Policy, Terms of Service and Change Log Hub links, and synchronised the canonical version plus changelog records to v2.6.0.
- Checked for a related GitHub issue and found no explicit linked issue in the current repo context, so issue-update templates were not posted during this implementation pass.

### Affected areas

- Website: www.apes.org.uk
- Page or route: homepage hero and route finder, Services hub, Bookings, Educational visits, About APES, Fundraising priorities, Help Us Move, Change Log Hub, footer version display and regenerated static HTML snapshots
- Files changed: shared PHP rendering, shared CSS, shared site data, VERSION, public VERSION, root CHANGELOG, public CHANGELOG and regenerated static HTML snapshots
- User groups affected: supporters, adopters, service users, volunteers, partners, educators and general public visitors
- Public impact: visitors now see warmer, route-relevant visuals across key public journeys with responsive image delivery and no route or footer-link changes
- Internal impact: reusable image metadata and shared media rendering now support future APES visual placements from a central source of truth

### Version decision

- Previous version: v2.5.0
- New version: v2.6.0
- Version type: minor stable
- Reason for version bump: new public-facing visual content and shared rendering capabilities added across multiple core routes without a breaking restructure

### Validation

- Checks run: local PHP syntax checks, shared CSS/PHP inspection, WebP asset generation, static HTML export and generated HTML inspection
- Manual checks completed: homepage hero and compact route-finder layout review, Services hub route-finder and care-image review, Bookings and Educational visits image stacking review, Fundraising and Help Us Move image placement review, footer required link review, APES Newsroom route review and changelog/version alignment review
- Known limitations: validation in this environment focused on generated output and local inspection rather than a full live-browser comparison on every published route
- Rollback notes: restore the previous shared renderer, shared CSS, image references, version files and changelog entries, then re-export the static HTML snapshots if the image rollout needs to be reversed

## [v2.5.0] - 2026-06-03

<span class="pill pill-version">Version v2.5.0</span>
<span class="pill pill-status">Stable</span>
<span class="pill pill-type">Changed</span>
<span class="pill pill-accessibility">Accessibility</span>
<span class="pill pill-compliance">Compliance</span>

### Summary

Promoted the shared hero into a full-width site header panel, moved the previous hero-side support cards into the lower sidebar across all rendered public routes, and synchronised the release metadata to the new minor stable version.

### Detailed changes

- Updated the shared PHP page renderer so the hero panel now spans the full content width while the logo, contact and connected-service cards render in the lower page sidebar above page-specific related links.
- Reworked the shared stylesheet so the new full-width hero and lower two-column body/sidebar layout behave consistently across the homepage, inner content routes, Change Log Hub and 404 page without changing route copy or CTA destinations.
- Preserved APES Newsroom routing, footer structure, required donation, Privacy Policy, Terms of Service and Change Log Hub links, and intranet link rules while applying the shared layout shift.
- Bumped the canonical version and synchronised the website Change Log Hub, root changelog, public changelog mirror and exported static HTML snapshots to v2.5.0.

### Affected areas

- Website: www.apes.org.uk
- Page or route: homepage hero, all shared inner-page hero/sidebar layouts, Change Log Hub, 404 page, footer version display and regenerated static HTML snapshots
- Files changed: shared PHP rendering, shared CSS, shared site data, VERSION, public VERSION, root CHANGELOG, public CHANGELOG and regenerated static HTML snapshots
- User groups affected: supporters, adopters, service users, volunteers, partners and general public visitors
- Public impact: visitors now see a full-width hero followed by a clearer lower content/sidebar layout that keeps support cards available without crowding the page header
- Internal impact: the shared renderer now owns a single full-width hero pattern across all exported public routes and the release metadata is aligned at v2.5.0

### Version decision

- Previous version: v2.4.6
- New version: v2.5.0
- Version type: minor stable
- Reason for version bump: site-wide public layout change across the shared rendering system without route or content-model changes

### Validation

- Checks run: shared PHP renderer review, shared CSS review, local PHP syntax checks, static HTML export and generated HTML inspection
- Manual checks completed: homepage, representative top-level route, nested route, Change Log Hub and 404 layout review; footer required link review; intranet link attribute review; APES Newsroom route review; changelog/version alignment review
- Known limitations: final browser QA is limited to local rendered/output inspection in this environment rather than a full live-browser pass across every route
- Rollback notes: restore the previous shared renderer, CSS and release metadata, then re-export the static HTML snapshots if the new layout needs to be reverted

## [v2.4.6] - 2026-06-03

<span class="pill pill-version">Version v2.4.6</span>
<span class="pill pill-status">Stable</span>
<span class="pill pill-type">Changed</span>
<span class="pill pill-fix">Fix</span>
<span class="pill pill-compliance">Compliance</span>
<span class="pill pill-accessibility">Accessibility</span>

### Summary

Tightened the shared hero layout so the primary content panel no longer leaves an oversized gap below the call-to-action buttons, and synchronised the release metadata back to the canonical site version.

### Detailed changes

- Updated the shared hero grid so the hero panel aligns to its content instead of stretching to match the taller hero aside, which removes the empty space beneath the hero buttons on the homepage and all shared inner-page hero variants.
- Applied the change in the shared stylesheet only, leaving route content, hero copy, buttons, footer structure and APES Newsroom destinations untouched.
- Re-synchronised the canonical version, website Change Log Hub and root changelog after correcting the existing mismatch between the repository `VERSION` file and the rendered site release metadata.
- Regenerated the exported static HTML snapshots and synchronised the canonical version, website Change Log Hub and root changelog.

### Affected areas

- Website: www.apes.org.uk
- Page or route: homepage shared hero, inner-page shared hero pattern, Change Log Hub, footer version display and regenerated static HTML snapshots
- Files changed: shared CSS, shared site data, VERSION, root CHANGELOG and regenerated static HTML snapshots
- User groups affected: supporters, adopters, service users, volunteers, partners and general public visitors
- Public impact: visitors now see a tighter hero layout with less empty space beneath hero actions, while footer version text and release records now consistently show v2.4.6
- Internal impact: shared hero sizing now behaves consistently across rendered routes and the repository release metadata matches the generated site output again

### Version decision

- Previous version: v2.4.5
- New version: v2.4.6
- Version type: patch stable
- Reason for version bump: small public-facing layout fix across the shared hero component with no route or content restructure

### Validation

- Checks run: shared CSS inspection, local PHP syntax checks, static HTML export and generated HTML inspection
- Manual checks completed: homepage and representative inner-page hero spacing review, footer required link review, footer version alignment review, APES Newsroom route review and changelog synchronisation review
- Known limitations: final browser QA depends on local rendered output spot checks rather than opening every exported route individually
- Rollback notes: restore the previous shared CSS and release metadata, then re-export the static HTML snapshots if needed
