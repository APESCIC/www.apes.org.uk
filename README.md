## Current release

- Version: `v2.8.4`
- Release date: `2026-06-04`
- Release impact: restored the APES development notice so new visitors see the site-under-development warning, can dismiss it, and do not get it again on the same browser after dismissal.
- Operational note: shared PHP, CSS and JS files remain the source of truth; this pass manually synchronised the exported HTML because no local PHP runtime was available, so complete a post-deploy check that the development notice, local-storage dismissal, live chat CTA, footer required links and branded error pages still behave correctly once PHP export can be rerun in a PHP-enabled environment.

| **Pet Care** | Public pet care support, clinic information, advice, bookings and service resources. |
| **Adoption and Fostering** | Eligibility, process, expectations, application routes and responsible placement information. |

## 🔗 Connected APES services

The website may link to or support access to wider APES services and platforms, including:

- APES Shelter and Rescue.
- APES Pet Care Clinic.
- APES CareBase.
- APES News.
- MyAPES Portal.
- APES Workspace.
- APES Network Status.
- APES support and helpdesk systems.

Any change affecting linked services must be checked carefully so users are directed to the correct platform and are not given outdated, confusing or unsafe instructions.

---

## 🎨 APES Habitat design direction

The website should use a **green-led APES Habitat theme**: public-friendly, accessible, welfare-focused and recognisably APES.

### Brand principles

- **Mission-led:** connect major features back to animal welfare, rescue, rehabilitation, education, public benefit or governance.
- **Friendly and colourful:** use habitat-inspired shapes, animal-welfare cues, rounded cards and clear service colour bands.
- **Publicly clear:** design must make rescue routes, service eligibility, contact routes and support pathways easy to understand.
- **Accessible by default:** colour contrast, keyboard navigation, readable typography and plain-language labels are mandatory.
- **Reusable:** use shared tokens, components and templates so new pages remain consistent.

### Suggested colour tokens

| Token | Suggested use |
|---|---|
| **Forest Green** | Primary navigation, headers, governance and high-trust areas. |
| **Leaf Green** | Positive states, active indicators, welfare updates and primary buttons. |
| **Mint** | Soft backgrounds, low-pressure information panels and content cards. |
| **Teal** | Shelter, rescue and operational cards. |
| **Sky Blue** | Pet care, guidance, help and knowledge-base content. |
| **Purple** | People, volunteering, training and community content. |
| **Coral / Orange** | Calls to action, campaign banners and non-critical warnings. |
| **Warm Sand** | Calm page background accents and break sections. |
